# Capstone-Project

This is the Udacity Capstone final project. It will be a New York City Travel app.
<br /><br />
New York Travel guide is a simple tourist attraction app that aims to help guide you around
some of the highlights of New York city. It provides a list and a map of some of the key sites to
visit around New York City.
<br /><br />
Userâ€™s can read reviews of the attractions and even add new reviews of their own. The app
allows you to add favourite attractions so they can be quickly found.
